79,"When performing the sleeve removal maneuver, when the hole was 600 meters deep, General da Silva pressed only one side of the locking nut of the rods, which together with the jack, holds the entire weight of the rods in the maneuver. As the locking procedure was not effective, the weight of the rods was only secured by the steel wire rope of the probe winch.

156,"When the mechanical technician proceeded to perform the maintenance of motor supports of a tipper, he decided to bring a wooden block, for which he moved to the temporary storage of materials - located at 10 m. of the tipper - in circumstances in which he sought the cue; the camera of a tire burst suddenly (it was on the right and 2 m. of the involved); the thunderous sound affected the right ear of the worker. The tire that exploded has 110 psi of pressure approximately, at the time of the event they were stacked 3 pneumatic, the second was the one that exploded (presented cut - place where the energy was released).

169,"During execution of drilling on the target - Bolt BRJCLDD0006, made by the company SERVITECFORACO - probe 25, at 09:45 on July 9, 2016, the official Josimar da Silva, in the moment of the maneuver to fish material, when removing the feeder of water, during movement of the winch realized that the safety chain was loose and could curl in the rod.

338,"On 02/25/2017 at 13:05 p.m., when assisting with GPS in the Magnetometric collaborator Gilvânio bumped the top of the field hat on a branch and was attacked by maribondos. The moths went towards his eyes, but due to the use of sunglasses, the attack in that region was prevented. The insects moved to the side of the face, getting caught between the ear and the back of the field hat, making the helper get two bites behind the ear.

349,"On 08/03/2017 at 3:30 PM, when performing MAG activity, the employee Murilo da Silva, when moving in the acquisition line, came across a small drainage (approximately 40cm wide), with small gap.

389,"When performing shotcrete casting for resane on Cruise 791 Nv. 1940 at 02:50 p.m. approximately, the operator was placed on the left side of the equipment and started the release of 02 cubic meters, at that time decided to paralyze the task for a few minutes due to a leak of water in the roof box that did not allow the adhesion of the shotcrete to the rock (setting).
